# ReFi Tokens and NFTs

Currently the regenerative finance (ReFi) movement has created both tokens and NFTs. Examples of tokens created are from Toucan Protocol (BCT, NCT), Moss (MCO2), and Klima (Klima). Examples of NFT projects are Unios, NFTree Haus, Endangered Tokens and Ecolabs. ReFi tokens need more holders to increase the token value and the ReFi NFT projects need increased intrinsic value to gain traction. By layering NFTs with tokens an intrinsic value of the NFT is able to be created and the tokens have more holders (the NFTs).

Tokens layered on the NFTs can be yield bearing (such as Aave aTokens). The yield from tokens embedded in NFTs can be directed towards buying ReFi tokens and furthering the number of tokens layered on the NFT (as well as holders of ReFi tokens: the NFTs).

Avano in collaboration with other communities (such as ReFiDAO) continually maps out the ReFi space. NFT projects that emerge are whitelisted for being layered and tokens that arise are utilized for layering. In the future, this whitelisting step will be skipped and any NFT can be layered.

Community members choose what yield bearing token they would like to charge the NFT with as well as what ReFi token the yield should buy. Other yield bearing sources will be sought and integrated (such as Olympus, and Klima potentially). Anyone can input tokens into the NFT, not only the holder. Inputing tokens onto the NFT can be done repeatedly.

In future updates, we may financially incentivize users to burn the layered NFT to retrieve the tokens. As well as create ReFi Index funds from these mechanics.
