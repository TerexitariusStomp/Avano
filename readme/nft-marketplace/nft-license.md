# NFT License

We want artists to be able to protect their work the way they want to protect it. Different licenses (open use, to non proprietary) and the benefits that come with them are able to affect the value of the NFT. When artists are portraying their work for the first time they select the type of artistic license that is associated with that work. When the NFT is minted the license is embedded into the metadata. If wanted we can also register the artists work with the US copyright office, just select that license. Here is our current [licenses document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hVar-DroYsfGxAcE3roVOiSGnltohyO-XhgzALp8Hj0/edit?usp=sharing).  A good example of NFT licenses is [Verisart](https://verisart.com/our-certificates).
