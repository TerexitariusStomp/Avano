# On Reserve

We want artists to have the freedom to choose or not the buyers of their art pieces. This allows them to develop a close art loving community. For artists who choose this option, they put their work on reserve so that only the people they want having it are able to buy it. Artists can also nominate someone to curate the list of eligible individuals, an example could be the person depicted in the artists NFT. This feature is only able to be done within our marketplace but does not stop others not on the list from buying it in other marketplaces.&#x20;
