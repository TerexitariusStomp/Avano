# Unbroken Royalties

We want the people who contributed to making the NFT a reality to continue to get rewarded for it as long as the NFT exists. This includes the artists, regenerative organization, and Akorn DAO. For this we embed into the code of the NFT mechanisms that allow for royalty transfer no matter the chain and marketplace the NFT is on. An example for unbroken royalties is [CXIP](https://cxip.io).&#x20;

## Inheritance

When we say we want to have the contributors earn royalties for as long as the NFT exists, we mean it. If a contributing member dies we want to have them set up an inheritor to pass the royalties onto. &#x20;
